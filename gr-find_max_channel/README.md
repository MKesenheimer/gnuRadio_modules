# gr-find_max_channel

This block can be used to find the index of the value in a vector with the maximum value.
For example, if the vector
```
(4, 7, 1, 5)
```
is given as input, this block returns `1` as the index of the the biggest value.
This may be used to find the frequency (= channel) with the stronges signal.
